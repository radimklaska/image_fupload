IMAGE FUpload MODULE
--------------------

Image FUpload (Multiupload) which is an addition to image module, 
gives the ability to every user who is allowed to upload images by 
using image module, to upload multiple images with one simple click. 
All selected images are uploaded via a flash module (swfupload) and are 
automatically processed.
So, there’s no need any more to upload image by image.
